# script for backup locally on external drive 

 <h2><B> shell script automatically backups a specified source directory to an external  drive when it is connected to the system. </B></h2>
 
<h3>  The script waits for the external hard drive to be connected before starting the backup, and then logs the start 
and end times of the backup and source/destination paths.

The backup process can be customized by modifying the values of backup_dir and source_dir to specify the paths of the 
backup destination and source directory, respectively. The log_file variable can also be customized to specify the path of the log file where the backup details will be recorded.


We can also modify script to automatically run when external device with specific drive(with unique id) is connected. </h3>
